Readme file for running the MATLAB scriptsCodes:- code_fig6c.m- code_fig6d.m We tested these codes on MATLAB R2020a and R2022a.System requirements:- MATLAB R2015 or later- No non-standard hardware or other dependencies are necessaryRuntimes for both scripts are negligible (< 1 second).Outputs:- 'code_fig6c.m' generates Fig. 6c of our paper.- 'code_fig6d.m' generates Fig. 6d of our paper.Instructions:1. Install MATLAB (requires purchasing a commercial license: R2015 or later version). Typical install time on a desktop computer would be less than 1.5 hours.2. Data for the simulations are already written into the two MATLAB files above. Simply open the two files in this repository and then run both codes in MATLAB.
